Mathematical Operator-
Mathematical operators perform basic mathematic operations on the operands. Below we have shown all Mathematical operators with their examples.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Add	7+3=10
–	Subtract	7-3=4
*	Multiply	7*3=21
/	Divide	7/3=2.34
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment (Increase answer by 1)
– 	Decrement (Decrease answer by 1)
