Q-1-----------------------------------------------

Mathematical Operator-
Mathematical operators perform basic mathematic operations on the operands. Below we have shown all Mathematical operators with their examples.

Operator-----Description-----Example<br>
+	Add	7+3=10
–	Subtract	7-3=4
*	Multiply	7*3=21
/	Divide	7/3=2.34
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment (Increase answer by 1)
– 	Decrement (Decrease answer by 1)	

Q-2-------------------------------------------------------

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to analyze equality or difference between variables or values.

Operator	Description<br>
==	        Equal to<br>
!=	        Not equal
>	        Greater than
<	        Less than
>=	        Greater than or equal to
<=	        Less than or equal to
